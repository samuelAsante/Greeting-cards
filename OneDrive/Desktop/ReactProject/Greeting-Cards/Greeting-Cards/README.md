# Greeting Cards 

## Project Overview
This is a simple React application that displays greeting cards with a title and message. The project was built using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It taught me how to:
- Create and use React components.
- Pass data (props) to components.
- Style an application with Tailwind CSS.

The app has a header and three greeting cards with different messages.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Discussion
I learned how to set up a React project using Vite and integrate Tailwind CSS for styling. It was interesting to see how components interact and how data flows between them using props.  

Overall, this project helped me understand the basics of React development and how to create a responsive UI.
